# Language Usage Policy

- **Main project languages**: Python and shell scripts (bash)
- **Warning requirement**: Developers must be warned if code in other languages is to be committed to the main project repository
- When proposing commits that include non-Python/non-bash code, explicitly notify developers about the language change
